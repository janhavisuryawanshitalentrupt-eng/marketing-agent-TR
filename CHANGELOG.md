# Changelog — Talentrupt Marketing Agent

All notable changes to the app, most recent first. Dates are when the work landed on
`feat/create-chip-brief-intake`.

## Content & viewing (2026-06-30)
- **No more stamped logo on generated images.** The Talentrupt "TR" badge that was composited onto every
  AI image is removed — images ship clean and use the full canvas (the "keep the corner empty" reservation
  is gone). The no‑wordmark guard stays so the model still won't *draw* a brand name. (Team‑photo posts and
  the deterministic fallback are separate paths and unchanged.)
- **Images/videos preview in‑app, not a new tab.** The "view" (eye) action — and clicking the image — now
  opens an in‑app lightbox modal (download + close) instead of `target="_blank"`. (`AssetCard.tsx`.)
- **External campaign "Content calendar" → "Content ideas."** It's now an inspiration board (dated
  post/image/deck ideas you can reschedule); the per‑row Generate/Open was removed — generate from Chat or
  Create. Backend/data untouched.

## Image design variety (2026-06-30)
- **Designs lock to the post's TOPIC (not off-theme).** The art-director now plans a topic-specific
  `scene` (the concrete imagery to depict — analytics dashboards for a data post, a yoga pose for a yoga
  post, players/pitch for a football post) and the renderer treats that scene as the **AUTHORITATIVE
  subject**, overriding the style templates' generic example subjects (handshakes, office props). So a
  data-driven post gets data designs and a culture post gets that culture's imagery — never an unrelated
  theme. The VARIETY is in the LOOK (palette/decoration); the SUBJECT stays on the topic.
- **Generated images no longer all share one look.** The image prompt forced the SAME skin on every post
  (fixed navy/coral/cream palette + a headline with exactly one coral word + the same coral starburst/
  squiggle motifs). Now each image picks a **color palette** and a **decoration treatment** that vary
  image-to-image, **context-aware**: RPO/sales content stays close to brand (the signature look is
  weighted ~45%), internal campaigns roam the full palette set. The format is ALL that changed — quality
  and content rules are untouched (blur gate, face guard, logo overlay + bottom-right space,
  no-fabrication, brief grounding). One shared engine, so it applies to **Create and internal campaigns**.

## UI (2026-06-30)
- **Account menu.** The header now shows just your **avatar**; clicking it opens a dropdown with your
  name, email, a light/dark **theme toggle**, and **Sign out** (closes on outside-click / Esc). Replaces
  the always-on name + email + logout + theme icons.
- **Stream retry widened to cover a deploy restart.** Chat/Create/Campaign streams now retry the initial
  connection for ~4s (up to 5 attempts) on a transient 502/network blip, so the brief backend restart
  during a deploy no longer surfaces as "network error".

## Accounts & security (2026-06-29)
- **Member login added** — `nishant@talentrupt.com` signs in as a non-admin **member**; the existing
  `Admin@talentrupt.com` stays admin. Role is derived server-side from the bearer token (`/api/auth/me`),
  so it can't be spoofed from the browser.
- **Tasks & Analytics are admin-only** — hidden from the member's nav *and* their APIs return 403, so a
  member can't reach that data even by calling the endpoints directly.
- **Per-account data isolation** — every owned record (conversations, campaigns, assets, opportunities,
  tasks, uploads) now carries an `owner` and is scoped to the logged-in account. Each account sees only
  its own data; cross-account get/delete returns 404. Existing data is assigned to **admin** by a
  one-time migration that runs automatically on startup. (Fixes "one account's info showing on another".)

## Campaigns & chat accuracy (2026-06-30)
- **Chat no longer mislabels campaigns.** Asked "how many *internal* campaigns", chat was lumping
  external client-targeting "RPO Outreach" campaigns in as internal. The `list_campaigns` tool now
  splits results by **type** (internal = promote Talentrupt; external = client-targeting), takes a
  `type` filter, and — critically — is **owner-scoped** (it was counting every account's campaigns).
  `list_assets` was owner-scoped for the same leak.
- **Archived campaigns are viewable & restorable.** Archived campaigns now hide from the active rails
  (they were leaking into the Internal rail) and live under a **"View archived"** toggle in Campaigns,
  each with a **Restore** action. `GET /api/campaigns` hides archived by default; `?status=archived`
  lists them.

## Reliability & fixes (2026-06-30)
- **Blurry images no longer ship.** gpt-image-1 occasionally returns a soft/out-of-focus frame. The
  pipeline now measures each frame's sharpness (variance-of-Laplacian, calibrated: sharp ≈ 1000–1300,
  blurry < ~220) and, when a frame is soft, **regenerates and keeps the sharpest** (up to 3 tries) before
  the gentle crisp pass. Sharp frames pass on the first try, so the extra cost only kicks in on a
  genuinely blurry result. (`generation/images.py:_sharpness` / `_openai_image`.)
- **Campaign clients no longer come back empty for overlapping sectors.** The client purity gate
  required an exact sector match, so healthcare *staffing* agencies (labeled "Staffing & Recruiting")
  were dropped from a **Healthcare** campaign — leaving 0 clients. The gate now also keeps a company
  when its segment text clearly belongs to the campaign's sector, so a "healthcare staffing agency"
  correctly counts as a Healthcare target. (`main.py:_segment_ok_for_sector`.)
- **Streams ride through restart blips.** Chat/Create/Campaign streams now retry the initial
  connection on a transient `502/503/504` or a pre-response network drop (which happen briefly during a
  deploy restart) instead of immediately surfacing "network error" / "Request failed (502)".

## Branding (2026-06-30)
- **Logo refined to the M mark only** — the header/login/loading badge dropped the white tile; the "M"
  now uses `currentColor` for its legs so it adapts to **both light and dark themes** (navy on light,
  white on dark), with the coral swoosh constant. The favicon is theme-aware too (via
  `prefers-color-scheme`), transparent, no tile.
- **App rebranded to "Myra".** The UI chrome — header, login, loading screen, page `<title>` and favicon —
  now shows the **Myra** name and a new "M" brand mark (navy legs + coral→pink swoosh), via the new
  `components/MyraLogo.tsx` and `app/icon.svg`. UI-only: auth/session keys, APIs, and the Talentrupt
  *content* brand used for generation are untouched, so the working flow is unchanged.
- **Clean static redeploys** — the deploy now wipes `frontend/out` before extracting the build, so assets
  removed from the build (like the old default `favicon.ico`) don't linger on the droplet (`tar -x`
  overlays files but never deletes ones dropped from a later build).

## Business Dev (2026-06-30)
- **C-level "Search LinkedIn" links now actually return results.** The people-search URL used to
  exact-quote BOTH the company and the title and AND them (e.g. `"SCIGON" "Chief Operating Officer"`),
  which LinkedIn answered with "No results found." Now the title is unquoted and the company is quoted
  only when it's multi-word — a high-recall query (`SCIGON Chief Operating Officer`) that lands the rep
  on the right people. The no-fabricated-names rule and the suppression of generic roles / ambiguous
  company names are unchanged. Existing prospects pick up the fix automatically (URLs regenerate on read).

## Campaigns (2026-06-29)
- **Internal vs External** split. Internal campaigns are a Create-style chat studio that promotes
  Talentrupt itself.
- **Brief-driven generation** — a new internal campaign **auto-generates a starter pack from its
  description**; the chat is then for edits. Editable brief via the **Brief** button (updates the
  grounding for future generations).
- **On-theme content** — the campaign brief now flows into *every* generator (image/post/deck/PDF), so a
  cricket campaign makes cricket content and a football campaign makes football content — no more
  off-theme "RPO DONE RIGHT" creatives leaking in. Magazine/brochure/etc. route to a PDF, not a deck.
- **Delete** control on each generated asset; the description is editable, not a static header.

## Images (2026-06-29)
- A deterministic **crisp-up pass** removes gpt-image-1's occasional soft/hazy frames, tuned to a gentle
  level (not over-sharpened).

## Deployment (2026-06-30)
- **Auto-deploy is live & green** — the GitHub Actions pipeline now deploys end-to-end on every push
  (build → ship → restart → health-check). Fixed three first-run issues: the scp source must live inside
  the workspace (`tar: empty archive`), deploys now **queue** instead of cancel mid-flight, and the
  post-restart health check **retries for ~60s** instead of a single `sleep 2` (uvicorn + migrations need
  a moment to boot, which was reporting a false failure even though the app was up).

## Deployment (2026-06-29)
- **Deploy verification** — `GET /api/health` now returns the live `version` (the deployed commit SHA,
  stamped by CI). Confirms from the outside exactly which commit is live after a deploy.
- **One-command, fully-automated release** — `deploy/ship.ps1 "what changed"` builds the frontend locally
  (pre-flight gate), commits, and pushes; the push triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which rebuilds
  the UI on GitHub's runner, ships it to the droplet, restarts `myra`, and health-checks `/api/health`.
  No manual droplet steps. One-time enablement = authorize a deploy key + add `DROPLET_HOST` /
  `DROPLET_SSH_KEY` repo secrets (see `deploy/DEPLOY.md` → "Auto-deploy enablement").
- **Single process** — the Next.js frontend is statically exported (`output: 'export'`) and served by the
  FastAPI/uvicorn process, so the whole app runs as **one** PM2 process (`myra`), no separate Node server.
- **Deploy artifacts** under `deploy/` — `bootstrap.sh` (one-command first-time setup), `nginx-myra.conf`,
  `ecosystem.config.js`, `deploy.sh`, and `DEPLOY.md`, all targeting **myra.htuniverse.com**.
- The heavy/optional team-photo cut-out deps (`rembg`/`onnxruntime`/`pillow-heif`) moved to
  `backend/requirements-optional.txt` so a default install resolves cleanly.

## Live
- **https://myra.htuniverse.com** on the shared HT droplet — see `deploy/DEPLOY.md`.
