# Changelog — Talentrupt Marketing Agent

All notable changes to the app, most recent first. Dates are when the work landed on
`feat/create-chip-brief-intake`.

## Accounts & security (2026-06-29)
- **Member login added** — `nishant@talentrupt.com` signs in as a non-admin **member**; the existing
  `Admin@talentrupt.com` stays admin. Role is derived server-side from the bearer token (`/api/auth/me`),
  so it can't be spoofed from the browser.
- **Tasks & Analytics are admin-only** — hidden from the member's nav *and* their APIs return 403, so a
  member can't reach that data even by calling the endpoints directly.
- **Per-account data isolation** — every owned record (conversations, campaigns, assets, opportunities,
  tasks, uploads) now carries an `owner` and is scoped to the logged-in account. Each account sees only
  its own data; cross-account get/delete returns 404. Existing data is assigned to **admin** by a
  one-time migration that runs automatically on startup. (Fixes "one account's info showing on another".)

## Campaigns (2026-06-29)
- **Internal vs External** split. Internal campaigns are a Create-style chat studio that promotes
  Talentrupt itself.
- **Brief-driven generation** — a new internal campaign **auto-generates a starter pack from its
  description**; the chat is then for edits. Editable brief via the **Brief** button (updates the
  grounding for future generations).
- **On-theme content** — the campaign brief now flows into *every* generator (image/post/deck/PDF), so a
  cricket campaign makes cricket content and a football campaign makes football content — no more
  off-theme "RPO DONE RIGHT" creatives leaking in. Magazine/brochure/etc. route to a PDF, not a deck.
- **Delete** control on each generated asset; the description is editable, not a static header.

## Images (2026-06-29)
- A deterministic **crisp-up pass** removes gpt-image-1's occasional soft/hazy frames, tuned to a gentle
  level (not over-sharpened).

## Deployment (2026-06-29)
- **Single process** — the Next.js frontend is statically exported (`output: 'export'`) and served by the
  FastAPI/uvicorn process, so the whole app runs as **one** PM2 process (`myra`), no separate Node server.
- **Deploy artifacts** under `deploy/` — `bootstrap.sh` (one-command first-time setup), `nginx-myra.conf`,
  `ecosystem.config.js`, `deploy.sh`, and `DEPLOY.md`, all targeting **myra.htuniverse.com**.
- The heavy/optional team-photo cut-out deps (`rembg`/`onnxruntime`/`pillow-heif`) moved to
  `backend/requirements-optional.txt` so a default install resolves cleanly.

## Live
- **https://myra.htuniverse.com** on the shared HT droplet — see `deploy/DEPLOY.md`.
