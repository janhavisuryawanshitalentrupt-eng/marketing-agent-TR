# Changelog — Talentrupt Marketing Agent

All notable changes to the app, most recent first. Dates are when the work landed on
`feat/create-chip-brief-intake`.

## Accounts & security (2026-06-29)
- **Member login added** — `nishant@talentrupt.com` signs in as a non-admin **member**; the existing
  `Admin@talentrupt.com` stays admin. Role is derived server-side from the bearer token (`/api/auth/me`),
  so it can't be spoofed from the browser.
- **Tasks & Analytics are admin-only** — hidden from the member's nav *and* their APIs return 403, so a
  member can't reach that data even by calling the endpoints directly.
- **Per-account data isolation** — every owned record (conversations, campaigns, assets, opportunities,
  tasks, uploads) now carries an `owner` and is scoped to the logged-in account. Each account sees only
  its own data; cross-account get/delete returns 404. Existing data is assigned to **admin** by a
  one-time migration that runs automatically on startup. (Fixes "one account's info showing on another".)

## Reliability & fixes (2026-06-30)
- **Campaign clients no longer come back empty for overlapping sectors.** The client purity gate
  required an exact sector match, so healthcare *staffing* agencies (labeled "Staffing & Recruiting")
  were dropped from a **Healthcare** campaign — leaving 0 clients. The gate now also keeps a company
  when its segment text clearly belongs to the campaign's sector, so a "healthcare staffing agency"
  correctly counts as a Healthcare target. (`main.py:_segment_ok_for_sector`.)
- **Streams ride through restart blips.** Chat/Create/Campaign streams now retry the initial
  connection on a transient `502/503/504` or a pre-response network drop (which happen briefly during a
  deploy restart) instead of immediately surfacing "network error" / "Request failed (502)".

## Branding (2026-06-30)
- **Logo refined to the M mark only** — the header/login/loading badge dropped the white tile; the "M"
  now uses `currentColor` for its legs so it adapts to **both light and dark themes** (navy on light,
  white on dark), with the coral swoosh constant. The favicon is theme-aware too (via
  `prefers-color-scheme`), transparent, no tile.
- **App rebranded to "Myra".** The UI chrome — header, login, loading screen, page `<title>` and favicon —
  now shows the **Myra** name and a new "M" brand mark (navy legs + coral→pink swoosh), via the new
  `components/MyraLogo.tsx` and `app/icon.svg`. UI-only: auth/session keys, APIs, and the Talentrupt
  *content* brand used for generation are untouched, so the working flow is unchanged.
- **Clean static redeploys** — the deploy now wipes `frontend/out` before extracting the build, so assets
  removed from the build (like the old default `favicon.ico`) don't linger on the droplet (`tar -x`
  overlays files but never deletes ones dropped from a later build).

## Business Dev (2026-06-30)
- **C-level "Search LinkedIn" links now actually return results.** The people-search URL used to
  exact-quote BOTH the company and the title and AND them (e.g. `"SCIGON" "Chief Operating Officer"`),
  which LinkedIn answered with "No results found." Now the title is unquoted and the company is quoted
  only when it's multi-word — a high-recall query (`SCIGON Chief Operating Officer`) that lands the rep
  on the right people. The no-fabricated-names rule and the suppression of generic roles / ambiguous
  company names are unchanged. Existing prospects pick up the fix automatically (URLs regenerate on read).

## Campaigns (2026-06-29)
- **Internal vs External** split. Internal campaigns are a Create-style chat studio that promotes
  Talentrupt itself.
- **Brief-driven generation** — a new internal campaign **auto-generates a starter pack from its
  description**; the chat is then for edits. Editable brief via the **Brief** button (updates the
  grounding for future generations).
- **On-theme content** — the campaign brief now flows into *every* generator (image/post/deck/PDF), so a
  cricket campaign makes cricket content and a football campaign makes football content — no more
  off-theme "RPO DONE RIGHT" creatives leaking in. Magazine/brochure/etc. route to a PDF, not a deck.
- **Delete** control on each generated asset; the description is editable, not a static header.

## Images (2026-06-29)
- A deterministic **crisp-up pass** removes gpt-image-1's occasional soft/hazy frames, tuned to a gentle
  level (not over-sharpened).

## Deployment (2026-06-30)
- **Auto-deploy is live & green** — the GitHub Actions pipeline now deploys end-to-end on every push
  (build → ship → restart → health-check). Fixed three first-run issues: the scp source must live inside
  the workspace (`tar: empty archive`), deploys now **queue** instead of cancel mid-flight, and the
  post-restart health check **retries for ~60s** instead of a single `sleep 2` (uvicorn + migrations need
  a moment to boot, which was reporting a false failure even though the app was up).

## Deployment (2026-06-29)
- **Deploy verification** — `GET /api/health` now returns the live `version` (the deployed commit SHA,
  stamped by CI). Confirms from the outside exactly which commit is live after a deploy.
- **One-command, fully-automated release** — `deploy/ship.ps1 "what changed"` builds the frontend locally
  (pre-flight gate), commits, and pushes; the push triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which rebuilds
  the UI on GitHub's runner, ships it to the droplet, restarts `myra`, and health-checks `/api/health`.
  No manual droplet steps. One-time enablement = authorize a deploy key + add `DROPLET_HOST` /
  `DROPLET_SSH_KEY` repo secrets (see `deploy/DEPLOY.md` → "Auto-deploy enablement").
- **Single process** — the Next.js frontend is statically exported (`output: 'export'`) and served by the
  FastAPI/uvicorn process, so the whole app runs as **one** PM2 process (`myra`), no separate Node server.
- **Deploy artifacts** under `deploy/` — `bootstrap.sh` (one-command first-time setup), `nginx-myra.conf`,
  `ecosystem.config.js`, `deploy.sh`, and `DEPLOY.md`, all targeting **myra.htuniverse.com**.
- The heavy/optional team-photo cut-out deps (`rembg`/`onnxruntime`/`pillow-heif`) moved to
  `backend/requirements-optional.txt` so a default install resolves cleanly.

## Live
- **https://myra.htuniverse.com** on the shared HT droplet — see `deploy/DEPLOY.md`.
